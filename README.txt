Disclaimer:
For this program, apostrophes are removed during presorting to normalize
the string. For instance, plane's and planes would be considered the same
word, and therefore included in the same anagram grouping.

Additionally, accented characters were normalized to characters without
accents during the presorting process. For their frequency hashes, they are
considered the same as their unaccented character.
